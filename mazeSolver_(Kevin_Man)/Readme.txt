[Reasoning towards Depth First Search Approach]

For the maze solver a Depth First Search was used to calculate maze solution.
I believe that the Depth First Search or DFS was the most ideal way of traversing a map.
This is due to the fact that a maze can be seen as a graph or a tree in its simplist forms, 
and DFS is a very popular algorithm for such forms.
For computation speed as well, I believe that DFS would allow for a fast computation speed of the maze.


 



[instructions and information on the project]

The project was completed within the Eclipse IDE, and has also been exported with the aid of the IDE.
Once the project is run, a window with two buttons will be present:


[File Browse Button]:  used to find the textfile with the maze within.

[Solve Maze Button]:   used to solve the maze once a file is chosen. If no File is chosen this button 
		       will not be accessible.



For reusing or testing another maze, I have not provided a reset function to reset all variables
within and as such, the program will not compute a different file. 


Please rerun the program for computing a different maze file.
